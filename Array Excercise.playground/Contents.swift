Sum of All:  Write a function that takes one argument, an array of Integers. No empty arrays will be passed in. The function should return the sum of all of the numbers in an array. For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 145.

Sum of Two: Write a function that takes one argument, an array of Integers. No empty arrays will be passed in. The function should return the sum of the two lowest positive numbers given an array of minimum 4 integers. For example, when an array is passed like [19, 5, 42, 2, 77], the output should be 7.

/*
Find the Odd (or Even) One Out: Write a function that takes in one argument, an array of Integers. The array must have at least 3 elements. All numbers except for one of them will be either even or odd. You job is to return that one number that is the exception. Below are some example inputs and outputs. Make sure your function works on them all.

Input: [1, 3, 5, 6], Output: 6
Input: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50], Output: 15
Input: [19, 5, 42, 1, 77], Output: 42
*/

var input1 = [1, 3, 5, 6]
var input2 = [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50]
var input3 = [19, 5, 42, 1, 77]
